Okay, let's break down the process of mapping events between a C++ SAX library and the EXIP library for converting XML to EXI and vice versa.

Both SAX and EXIP are event-driven parsing models. This makes the mapping relatively straightforward conceptually, as you're essentially translating one stream of events into another. You'll typically need a custom handler or listener that sits in between the two libraries.

Core Concept:

    XML to EXI: Use a SAX parser to read XML. Implement a SAX handler that receives SAX events. Inside this handler, for each SAX event received, call the corresponding function in the EXIP library to write that event to an EXI stream.
    EXI to XML: Use the EXIP library to read EXI. Implement a listener/callback mechanism (or use EXIP's read loop) to receive EXIP events. For each EXIP event received, call the corresponding method on a SAX handler interface (which could be a custom handler you implement to rebuild XML or feed into another SAX-aware XML writer).

Here's a more detailed look at the mapping for key events:

Process 1: XML to EXI (SAX Events -> EXIP Write Calls)

You will implement a class that inherits from your C++ SAX library's handler interface (e.g., ContentHandler, ErrorHandler, LexicalHandler). This class will also hold an EXIP encoder context.

    SAX Event: startDocument()
        Action: Initialize the EXIP encoder (exiCreateDocEncoder, configure options like schema ID, fidelity options, etc.). Write the EXI document header (exiWriteStartDocument).
        EXIP Call (Conceptual): exiCreateDocEncoder(...); exiWriteStartDocument(...);

    SAX Event: endDocument()
        Action: Finalize the EXIP encoder and flush any remaining data (exiWriteEndDocument). Clean up the encoder context.
        EXIP Call (Conceptual): exiWriteEndDocument(...); exiDestroyEncoder(...);

    SAX Event: startElement(uri, localName, qName, attributes)
        Action: Write the start element event using EXIP. You'll need to provide the namespace URI, local name, and potentially the qualified name. Crucially, you then need to iterate through the attributes list provided by SAX and write each attribute using EXIP.
        EXIP Call (Conceptual): exiWriteStartElement(encoder, uri, localName, qName?); Then loop through attributes: exiWriteAttribute(encoder, attrUri, attrLocalName, attrQName?); exiWriteCharacters(encoder, attrValueChars, attrValueLength);

    SAX Event: endElement(uri, localName, qName)
        Action: Write the end element event using EXIP.
        EXIP Call (Conceptual): exiWriteEndElement(encoder, uri, localName, qName?);

    SAX Event: characters(chars, length)
        Action: Write character data using EXIP. Note that a single text node in XML might be delivered as multiple characters calls by SAX. You might need to buffer these until the next non-character event or write them chunk by chunk.
        EXIP Call (Conceptual): exiWriteCharacters(encoder, chars, length);

    SAX Event: processingInstruction(target, data)
        Action: Write a processing instruction event.
        EXIP Call (Conceptual): exiWriteProcessingInstruction(encoder, target, data);

    SAX Event: comment(chars, length)
        Action: Write a comment event (if EXI fidelity options allow preserving comments).
        EXIP Call (Conceptual): exiWriteComment(encoder, chars, length);

    SAX Event: cdata(chars, length) (Often via LexicalHandler, or merged into characters)
        Action: EXI typically treats CDATA section content the same as regular character data. If your SAX library reports CDATA specifically, you might need to handle the startCDATA() and endCDATA() lexical events, but the content itself is usually written via exiWriteCharacters.
        EXIP Call (Conceptual): exiWriteCharacters(encoder, chars, length); (inside characters or cdata handler).

    SAX Event: startPrefixMapping(prefix, uri)
        Action: Manage namespace contexts. EXIP handles namespaces intrinsically with elements and attributes. You typically don't need a separate exiWritePrefixMapping call unless the EXI options require explicit namespace declarations at specific points, or you need to declare a prefix that isn't used on an element/attribute name within its scope. Often, EXIP can infer necessary declarations. Track these mappings in your handler if needed for qName handling or explicit declarations.
        EXIP Call (Conceptual): Often implicit within exiWriteStartElement and exiWriteAttribute. If explicit mapping is needed: exiWriteNamespaceDeclaration(encoder, prefix, uri);

    SAX Event: endPrefixMapping(prefix)
        Action: Pop the namespace context. No direct EXIP write call usually needed, but essential for internal handler state if tracking namespaces.

Process 2: EXI to XML (EXIP Read Events -> SAX Handler Calls)

You will use the EXIP decoder to read events. As you read events, you will call the corresponding methods on an instance of your custom SAX handler class (which could build the XML string or write it to a stream).

    EXIP Operation: Initialize decoder, loop reading events (exiReadNextEvent).
        Action: Based on the type of event returned by exiReadNextEvent, call the appropriate SAX handler method. You'll need to extract data from the EXIP event structure.

    EXIP Event: Start Document (EXI_EVENT_START_DOCUMENT)
        Action: Call the SAX startDocument() method.
        SAX Call (Conceptual): saxHandler->startDocument();

    EXIP Event: End Document (EXI_EVENT_END_DOCUMENT)
        Action: Call the SAX endDocument() method.
        SAX Call (Conceptual): saxHandler->endDocument();

    EXIP Event: Start Element (EXI_EVENT_START_ELEMENT)
        Action: Read the element name details (exiReadStartElement). Important: In EXI, attributes for an element follow the Start Element event before any child nodes or the End Element. You must read all subsequent EXI_EVENT_ATTRIBUTE events before calling startElement on your SAX handler. Collect the attribute details (name, value) while reading them. Then, call the SAX startElement() method, passing the element name and the collected attributes.
        EXIP Call (Conceptual): Loop: exiReadNextEvent(). If EXI_EVENT_START_ELEMENT: exiReadStartElement(...). Then loop: exiReadNextEvent(). If EXI_EVENT_ATTRIBUTE: exiReadAttribute(...), collect attribute. Repeat until non-attribute event. Then: saxHandler->startElement(uri, localName, qName, attributes); (passing collected attributes). Push element context onto stack.

    EXIP Event: End Element (EXI_EVENT_END_ELEMENT)
        Action: Read the end element details (exiReadEndElement). Call the SAX endElement() method.
        EXIP Call (Conceptual): exiReadEndElement(...). Get element info from stack. saxHandler->endElement(uri, localName, qName); Pop element context from stack.

    EXIP Event: Characters (EXI_EVENT_CHARACTERS)
        Action: Read character data (exiReadCharacters). Call the SAX characters() method. A single text node in XML might correspond to one or more EXI_EVENT_CHARACTERS. Your SAX handler needs to be prepared to receive these chunks.
        EXIP Call (Conceptual): exiReadCharacters(...). saxHandler->characters(chars, length);

    EXIP Event: Processing Instruction (EXI_EVENT_PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION)
        Action: Read processing instruction data (exiReadProcessingInstruction). Call the SAX processingInstruction() method.
        EXIP Call (Conceptual): exiReadProcessingInstruction(...). saxHandler->processingInstruction(target, data);

    EXIP Event: Comment (EXI_EVENT_COMMENT)
        Action: Read comment data (exiReadComment). Call the SAX comment() method (if your handler implements LexicalHandler).
        EXIP Call (Conceptual): exiReadComment(...). saxHandler->comment(chars, length);

    EXIP Event: Namespace Declaration (EXI_EVENT_NAMESPACE_DECLARATION)
        Action: Read namespace declaration details (exiReadNamespaceDeclaration). Call the SAX startPrefixMapping() method. You will need to track the currently in-scope namespaces to provide the correct uri and qName to the startElement and endElement calls on your SAX handler.
        EXIP Call (Conceptual): exiReadNamespaceDeclaration(...). saxHandler->startPrefixMapping(prefix, uri); Manage namespace stack.

Implementing the Reconstruction (EXI -> XML)

Your custom SAX handler, receiving events from the EXIP-to-SAX mapping layer, will be responsible for generating the XML output. This involves:

    Keeping track of the current element depth and open tags.
    Writing the start tag, attributes, character data, and end tag as the corresponding SAX events are received.
    Handling indentation if desired.
    Managing namespace declarations for the output XML, potentially using the prefix mappings received.

Key Considerations and Challenges:

    Specific Library APIs: The exact function names and data structures for both your chosen C++ SAX library (e.g., Xerces-C++, Libxml2's push parser API) and EXIP will dictate the implementation details.
    Error Handling: Both parsing processes can encounter errors (malformed XML/EXI, I/O errors). Your mapping logic needs to include robust error checking and reporting.
    Namespace Management: This is often the trickiest part. You need to ensure that namespace prefixes declared in the input (XML or EXI) are correctly mapped and declared in the output. When going from EXI to SAX, you'll need to synthesize startPrefixMapping events based on EXI_EVENT_NAMESPACE_DECLARATION and the namespace URIs/prefixes used in elements/attributes.
    Attribute Handling (EXI -> SAX): Remember that EXIP delivers attributes after the start element event. Your EXIP reading loop must buffer these attributes before making the single startElement call to the SAX handler with all attributes.
    Fidelity Options: EXI has fidelity options that control whether comments, processing instructions, DTDs, etc., are preserved. Your mapping should respect these options.
    Schema vs. Schemaless EXI: If you're using schema-informed EXI, both the SAX parser (potentially for validation) and the EXIP processor will need access to the schema. The event mapping itself is largely the same, but the configuration and processing context are different.
    Buffering: Character data and attributes might require internal buffering within your mapping layer.

In summary, the process involves creating a "bridge" layer using custom handlers/listeners that translate the event stream from one library's API to the other library's API calls. The XML-to-EXI direction listens to SAX and calls EXIP "write" functions, while the EXI-to-XML direction listens to EXIP "read" events and calls SAX handler methods.
